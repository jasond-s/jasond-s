## 👻💥 Hi, my name is Jason. I am an engineer 💀🧑‍💻

I have been an analog electronics engineer, a front-end engineer, and a few other kinds of engineer in between. I started at the bottom of the OSI stack and now I can usually be found somewhere that has been popped off the top.

I try to teach everything I learn through mentoring, blogging, or speaking at events. I am super stoked about how awesome and powerful technology can be and I want to try and get other people as excited as I am.
